# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

There are many like them, but these are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend.  They are my life.  I must
master them as I must master my life.

Without me, my dotfiles are useless.  Without my dotfiles, I am
useless.  I must maintain my dotfiles true.  I must have better
dotfiles than my enemy who is trying to pwn me.  I must own him
before he pwns me.  I will ...

My dotfiles and I know that what counts on UNIX is not the
processes that crash, the smashing of their stacks, nor the
corefiles they leave behind.  We know that it is the pwning that
counts.  We will pwn ...

My dotfiles are human, even as I am human, because they are my
life.  Thus, I will learn them as my brothers.  I will learn
their weaknesses, their strengths, their parts, their accessories,
their syntax, and their semantics.  I will keep my dotfiles clean
and ready, even as I am clean and ready.  We will become part of
each other.  We will ...

Before God, I swear this creed.  My dotfiles and I are the
defenders of system.  We are the masters of our enemy.  We are
the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is ours and there is no enemy, but peace!
