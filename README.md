## Overview

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these
are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend.  They are my life.  I must
master them as I must master my life.

Without me, my dotfiles are useless.  Without my dotfiles,
I am useless.  I must maintain my dotfiles true.  I must
have better dotfiles than my enemy who is trying to humble
me.  I must awe him before he shames me.  I will ...

My dotfiles and I know that what counts on UNIX is not the
processes that crash, the smashing of their stacks, nor the
corefiles they leave behind.  We know that it is correctness
that counts.  We will succeed ...

My dotfiles are human, even as I am human, because they are
my life.  Thus, I will learn them as my brothers.  I will
learn their weaknesses, their strengths, their parts, their
accessories, their syntax, and their semantics.  I will keep
my dotfiles clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.
We will become part of each other.  We will ...

Before God, I swear this creed.  My dotfiles and I are the
defenders of my world.  We are the masters of our enemy.
We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is ours and there is no corruption,
but perfection!
